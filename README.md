<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This repository contains a list of important utilities and files related to SSH.</p>

<h2>Project Motivation</h2>
<p>When you start using SSH, you encounter many concepts, and it's important to have a list of the key components in SSH. This repository serves that purpose.</p>

<h2>What is ssh</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSH (Secure Shell)</strong>: A network protocol used to securely access and manage network devices and computers over an unsecured network.</li>

<li><strong>Encryption</strong>: SSH provides a secure channel by encrypting the data transmitted between the client and the server.</li>

<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: It supports various authentication methods, including password and public-key authentication, to ensure only authorized users can access the system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Motivation for ssh</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: SSH provides robust encryption and authentication, ensuring secure and private communication between devices over potentially unsecured networks.</li>

<li><strong>Remote Management</strong>: It allows administrators and users to remotely manage and configure servers, routers, and other network devices securely.</li>
</ul>

<h2>SSH Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Remote Server Access</strong>: SSH allows users to securely connect to remote servers, enabling system administrators to manage servers and perform tasks as if they were physically present. For example, working on a Digital Ocean droplet from your PC.</li>


<li><strong>Automated Scripts</strong>: SSH is often used in scripts for automating tasks like backups, deployments, and monitoring, especially in DevOps environments, e.g., in GitHub Actions.</li>

<li><strong>Secure Git Access</strong>: Developers use SSH keys to securely interact with remote Git repositories, enabling safe code collaboration and version control.</li>

</ul>

<p>In all of these use cases, SSH uses a public/private key pair for authentication instead of a username/password. The public/private key pair is also used to encrypt the data passed between the client and server.</p>
